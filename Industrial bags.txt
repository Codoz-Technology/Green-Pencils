Here are four representative images of **industrial bags (FIBCs or “bulk bags”)** widely used across industries:

1. **Open-top, flat-bottom bulk bag** – simple structure with forklift loops, ideal for grains, powders, and aggregates.([palmetto-industries.com][1], [amazon.com][2])
2. **Spout-top/spout-bottom bag** – features top filling spout and bottom discharge spout, excellent for controlled handling of powders or granules.([palmetto-industries.com][3])
3. **High-capacity bulk bag (45 cu ft, 3 000 lb)** – food-grade & UV-resistant, frequently used for agricultural, construction, or food products.([sandbaggy.com][4])
4. **4‑loop U-panel FIBC** – durable woven polypropylene with reinforced panels, supporting up to 5 000 lb loads.([southernpackaginglp.com][5])

* **Materials**: Typically woven polypropylene, sometimes laminated; robust and feel-resistant.
* **Lifting & filling options**:

  * **4-lift loops** for forklift or crane handling.
  * **Top variations**: open-top, duffle-top, filling spouts.
  * **Bottom options**: flat for dumping, or discharge spout for metered unloading.
* **Load capacity**: Standard bags accommodate 2 000–4 000 lb, with safety factors around 5:1.([palmetto-industries.com][3], [palmetto-industries.com][1])
* **Safety types (static protection)**:

  * **Type A**: no static control
  * **Type B, C, D**: for environments needing static dissipation or grounding.([sunbeltpackagingllc.com][6])

## ⚙️ Choosing the Right Industrial Bag

| Feature              | Consideration                                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Capacity & Size**  | Choose based on weight (2–4k lb) and volume needs (25–50 cu ft+) |
| **Discharge needs**  | Flat-bottom for dumping, spout-bottom for controlled release     |
| **Static safety**    | Choose static category (A–D) based on environment and content    |
| **Regulatory needs** | Select food-grade, UV-coated, or UN-certified materials          |
